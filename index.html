		<p><b>Welcome to my website!</b> My name's Jacob Hodgins and I am an undergraduate electrical engineering student at the University of Ottawa.
			I'd define myself as a pretty hands on person, and always am taking any opportunity to experiment with things or learn some new skills. 
			I'm not all that nerdy though &#128516, I also LOVE to play sports and music. Feel free to check out my projects page and learn about 
			the things I'm super interested in!
