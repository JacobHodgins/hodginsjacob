    Welcome! For my first ever project uploaded to this website, I decided to combine my knowledge of circuits and software (prior to second year of university) to       create a functional and practical design. In this case, I created a digital metronome using an Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller, various electrical components, and     a solderless breadboard.
